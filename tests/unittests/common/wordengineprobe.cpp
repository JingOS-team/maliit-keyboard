//! \class WordEngineProbe
//! A word engine that deterministically predicts word candidates, in
//! such a way that it can be used for tests. Does not require
//! Hunspell or Presage. This word engine is for language where all
//! words begin with "a" and ends with "d". So, if we type "abc" we
//! can expect "abcd". If we type "abcd" we expect no candidates, but
//! it is a correct word. If we type "bcd" then we get no candidates,
//! because this word is wrong - it does not begin with "a".


//! \param parent The owner of this instance (optional).
